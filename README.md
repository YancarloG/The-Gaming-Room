* Briefly summarize The Gaming Room client and their software requirements. Who was the client? What type of software did they want you to design?

The client for this project was The Gaming Room, seeking enhancements for their Android game, "Draw It or Lose It," and an expansion to other platforms.

* What did you do particularly well in developing this documentation?

The documentation I developed for this project was kept clear, concise, and straight to the point.

* What about the process of working through a design document did you find helpful when developing the code?

In the design process, I found that working through a design document was helpful as it kept my focus on the task at hand, helping me prioritize essential tasks.

* If you could choose one part of your work on these documents to revise, what would you pick? How would you improve it?

If I were to revise one part of my work on these documents, it would be the recommendations section. While I understand the necessary steps internally, articulating them proved to be challenging for me.

* How did you interpret the user’s needs and implement them into your software design? Why is it so important to consider the user’s needs when designing?

To interpret the user's needs into the software design, I analyzed the game's functionality and strategically divided tasks to streamline expansion to other platforms while maintaining consistency. Considering user needs is vital, as their satisfaction ultimately determines the success of the product.

* How did you approach designing software? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to analyze and design a similar software application?

My approach to designing software involved a focus on clear documentation and segregating game functionality, facilitating easier updates and maintenance. In the future, I would continue employing these strategies for similar software applications.
